Inventory Management System UML Project

This project aims to design an Inventory Management System using Unified Modeling Language (UML). It includes several key UML diagrams to represent the system's structure and behavior.

Key Diagrams:

Use Case Diagram: Illustrates system functionalities from various user perspectives such as Admin, Supplier, and Customer.

State Machine Diagram: Represents the states and transitions of system objects, particularly inventory items.

Class Diagram: Depicts the static structure of the system, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.

Sequence Diagram: Shows the interactions between system components in specific scenarios, like a customer placing an order.
